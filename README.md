# Philosophy "Map of Thought" Project

[cite_start]An interactive, visual knowledge website dedicated to mapping the history of human thought. [cite: 4]

## Core Concept

[cite_start]This platform will present the history of philosophical thought as a branching mind map. [cite: 4] [cite_start]It is designed to allow users to explore philosophical schools, thinkers, and concepts in a dynamic and intuitive way. [cite: 4]

## Vision

[cite_start]The vision is to make philosophy explorable like Google Maps for human thought. [cite: 6] [cite_start]Users will be able to zoom into eras, navigate across different schools of thought, and discover how ideas evolved, diverged, and influenced one another over time. [cite: 6]

## Key Features

### 1. Node-Graph Interface
* [cite_start]**Schools of Thought:** Central nodes represent major schools (e.g., Stoicism, Existentialism, Confucianism). [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**Philosophers:** Connected nodes represent key thinkers (e.g., Plato, Kant, Nietzsche). [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]**Key Concepts:** Outer nodes represent their core ideas (e.g., Justice, Free Will, Virtue). [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Interactive Content:** Clicking any node reveals deeper content on its founders, ideas, criticisms, and modern relevance. [cite: 12]

### 2. Dual Views
[cite_start]Users can toggle between two primary modes to explore the data: [cite: 22]

* **Timeline View (History Mode):**
    * [cite_start]Features a chronological time slider from 500 BCE to Today. [cite: 14]
    * [cite_start]Reveals when ideas, philosophers, and schools emerged in history. [cite: 15]
    * [cite_start]Visualizes influence arrows showing how ideas shaped later thinkers. [cite: 16]

* **Concept View (Idea Mode):**
    * [cite_start]Clusters ideas thematically (e.g., Free Will, Knowledge, Justice). [cite: 18]
    * [cite_start]Maps philosophers across different eras who engaged with the same concept. [cite: 19]
    * [cite_start]Allows users to trace continuities and debates across time. [cite: 20]

### 3. Compare & Explore
* [cite_start]**Compare Mode:** A side-by-side comparison of two schools (e.g., Stoicism vs. Buddhism). [cite: 27]
* [cite_start]**Search:** A robust search function to find concepts or philosophers, which auto-highlights all related nodes on the map. [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]**Gamification:** Users can unlock hidden branches and achievements as they explore. [cite: 29]

## Data Backbone

[cite_start]The project is powered by a structured JSON knowledge base. [cite: 36]
* [cite_start]**Events:** Data points are anchored in history, such as a philosopher's publications, trials, or the founding of a school. [cite: 36, 37]
* [cite_start]**Concepts:** Data is also anchored in themes like Justice, Free Will, or Knowledge. [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Links:** Each event and concept connects to related schools and influences to build the web of ideas. [cite: 39]

## Project Status

* [cite_start]**Current Progress:** A skeleton timeline map has been structured, covering major eras from Ancient to Contemporary philosophy. [cite: 51]
* [cite_start]**Next Steps:** The immediate next step is to expand the map with philosophers, schools, and concepts, and to design the visual interactions. [cite: 52]

## Enhancements (Stretch Goals)

* [cite_start]**AI Companion:** To answer natural language questions about philosophy. [cite: 31]
* [cite_start]**Interactive Debates:** A feature to simulate philosophical clashes between different thinkers. [cite: 32]
* [cite_start]**Thematic Layers:** Filters for specific branches like ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. [cite: 33]
* [cite_start]**Community Contributions:** Allowing scholars or users to add commentary and expand the map. [cite: 34]
